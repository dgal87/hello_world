HELLO

My name is Daniel. I'm currently trying to develop some new skills.
I've always been interested in actually leverage data in a meaningful way.
When I was a teenager, I learned HTML and CSS to develop websites for my bands.
I really enjoyed it and wish I would have spent more time learning programming languages.
It's never too late!
